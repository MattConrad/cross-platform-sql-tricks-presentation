# Cross Platform SQL Tricks

This is a presentation of some SQL tricks which are handy and somewhat less known to people who don't live in a query window.

All of the SQL here is cross platform and will work on at least SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

This presentation used the [devICT presentation kit](https://github.com/devict/devict-presentation-template) which is itself based on the [reveal.js framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). Thanks Seth and Jacob!

Working SQL source code can be found in /app/presentation.sql.
